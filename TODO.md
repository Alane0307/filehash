## Options
### Option Storage
Should these live an object specific metadata or in filehashOption()?
### Compression
  * Nice option to be able to turn on/off (per list?)
  * Note that gzfile can cope with uncompressed files as well so this only
    needs to be set on write in theory.

### xdr
see ?serialize
to avoid byte swapping
